# FlameUp
A C++ command line tool used to backup files on demand/periodically

What more is there to say, this is the tool i use on my website server and i dont plan to add any documentation, when you run the exe (Releases) it will create the readme or you can run it with `-h` for info.

I made this tool for myself because i almost broke my entire website and it was down for 12 hours because of a react error and i had to switch web servers.
